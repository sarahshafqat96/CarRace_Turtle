# Road Crossing Game
Welcome to the Road Crossing Game. This is a fun and challenging game developed using Python's turtle module. The objective of the game is to guide the 
turtle across a busy road without getting hit by the moving cars. The game gets progressively more difficult as the player advances through 
the levels.

# Features
- Multiple lanes of traffic with cars moving at different speeds.
- Score and level tracking.
- Progressive difficulty as the player advances to higher levels.

# Information and Installation

The coding is done in 4 files stored in the "code" folder in this directory. All the images used for developing the GUI of the game are stored in the
"images" folder. Make sure you downloadd all the files in a single directory in your computer and run the "main.py" file on your local machine. I
have also uploaded an "output.png" file to give you an idea of what the game looks like.

You will just need Python installed on your local machine for this project.
